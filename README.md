# Telemetry-Olly0-Project

ðŸš€ **Telemetry-Olly0-Project** is an advanced observability project utilizing the OpenTelemetry Demo Application in a DevOps environment. This project demonstrates how to deploy, monitor, and trace an application using AWS, Docker, Grafana, Jaeger UI, and Load Generator UI.

## Project Overview

Telemetry-Olly0-Project is designed to explore and implement modern observability practices in a cloud-based DevOps environment. The project showcases the deployment of the OpenTelemetry Demo Application, leveraging tools like AWS, Docker, Grafana, and Jaeger for comprehensive monitoring and tracing.

_Description_: The diagram provides an overview of the deployment and observability stack, including how AWS, Docker, OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Jaeger, and the Load Generator UI are interconnected to monitor and trace the application.

## Features

- **Deployment**: Utilizes AWS and Docker to deploy the OpenTelemetry Demo Application.
- **Monitoring**: Integrates Grafana for real-time monitoring of application performance and health.
- **Tracing**: Implements Jaeger UI for distributed tracing and Load Generator UI for testing system performance.
- **Observability**: Provides insights into application behavior and system performance through advanced observability techniques.

## Tech Stack

- **AWS**: Cloud infrastructure for deploying the application.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for packaging and running the application.
- **OpenTelemetry**: Framework for generating and collecting telemetry data.
- **Grafana**: Monitoring tool for visualizing metrics and logs.
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing system for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Load Generator UI**: Tool for generating load to test application performance.

## Prerequisites

- AWS EC2 instance (xlarge)
- SSH access to the instance

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade the System

First, update and upgrade the system packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose

### Add Dockerâ€™s Official GPG Key

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

Add the Docker Repository to Apt Sources
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```
## Install Docker and Docker Compose
```
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
## Step 3: Start the Containers

Navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file and start the containers:
```
sudo docker compose up --force-recreate --remove-orphans --detach
```
## Conclusion
Your OpenTelemetry Demo Application should now be up and running on your AWS EC2 instance. You can monitor the performance and health using Grafana, explore the Jaeger UI for tracing, and use the Load Generator UI for testing.

Happy Observing! ðŸš€
